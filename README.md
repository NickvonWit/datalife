**About**: DataLife is measurement and analysis toolset for
distributed scientific workflows that use I/O and storage for task
composition. DataLife performs _data flow lifecycle_ (DFL) analysis to
guide decisions regarding coordinating tasks and data flows on
distributed resources. DataLife provides measurement, analysis,
visualization, and opportunity identification for data flow lifecycles
(DFLs). DataLife analysis involves a profiling and post-mortem
analysis phase. The profiling is distributed and scalable; and
currently focuses on POSIX and C I/O. The post-mortem analysis
provides several helpful analyses and visualizations to help identify
opportunities for improving task and data placement and resource
assignment.
