## Python notebook for the 1000Genome workflow
- This is the Python notebook for producing the `ranking table`, `Data Lifecycle Graph (Figure 3a)`, and `Caterpillar tree (Figure 4a and Figure 5)` for 1000Genome. 
- See Cell #40 for the generated DLG in Figure 3a.
- See Cell #38 for the generated Caterpillar tree in the formate of DLG in Figure 5.
- See Cell #42 for the generated Caterpillar tree in Figure 4a.
